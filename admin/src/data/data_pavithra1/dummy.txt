 another and through which people interact with one another. It is about designing interactive systems,
                      products and services for the home, for work or to support communities. Here are some examples of recent
                      interactive products and systems.
                      Example 1: iPhone
                      In 2007 A          pple Inc. changed the face of mobile technologies when they introduced the iPhone. The
                      iPhone had a carefully crafted, purpose-designed interface to make use of the finger as the input
                      device. It had a revolutionary touch-sensitive screen that allowed for multi-touch input. They

                                     computers are developed for successful interaction with humans. Historically and with some exceptions,
                                     computer system deve         lopers have not paid much attention to computer ease-of-use. Many computer users
                                     today would argue that computer makers are still not paying enough attention to making their products "userfriendly." However, computer system developers might argue that computers are extremely complex products
                                     to design an          d make and that the demand for the services that computers can provide has always outdriven the

         -obtrusively or even without the knowledge of the user. Collection of data usually does not re
         quire any special hardware and is so very cost effective. While HCI-based biometrics are not unique enough
         to provide reliable human identification they have been shown to provide high accuracy identity verification.
         In their interaction with computers human beings employ different strategies, use different style and apply uni
         que abilities and knowledge. Intrusion detection researchers attempt to quantify such HCI-based-biometric
          traits and use resulting feature profiles to successfully verify user identity and reject intruders. HCI-bas
          ed biometrics can be subdivided into two different categories known as direct and indirect HCI-based biometrics [3].     First group is made up of those biometrics which are based on direct human interaction with input devices such as keyboard [4-10], computer mouse [11-15], and haptics [16-18] which rely on supposedly innate, unique and stable muscle actions [19] and those biometrics which are based on advanced human behavior such
